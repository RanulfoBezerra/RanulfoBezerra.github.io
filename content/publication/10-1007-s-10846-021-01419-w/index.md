abstract: "Autonomous vehicles require high-level semantic maps, which contain the activities of pedestrians and cars, to ensure safe navigation. High-level semantics can be obtained from mobile probe sensor data. Analyzing pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data is an effective approach to avoid collisions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Such analyses of pedestrian trajectories can generate new information such as pedestrian behaviors in violation of traffic regulations. However, pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data significantly sparse and noisy, making it challenging to analyze pedestrian activity. To address this issue, we propose multiple daily data and graph-based approaches to treat sparse and noisy data for estimating the flow of pedestrians based on mobile probe data. To improve the sparseness of the data, multiple daily data are fused. After that, a pedestrian graph is created to enhance the regionâ€™s coverage by connecting the sparse data indicating the flow of pedestrians. This proposed approach successfully obtained pedestrian trajectory data from the sparse and noisy data. Moreover, it was possible to identify the potential locations where pedestrians tend to cross the street by analyzing the pedestrian flow. The results indicate that 83% of well-known regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street corresponded with those extracted using the proposed approach. Furthermore, a high-level semantic map of the regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street along a 1-km road is presented. The trajectory information obtained using the proposed approach is expected to be essential for understanding different scenarios of the interactions between individuals and autonomous vehicles."
