 abstract = {Sensing position and orientation of construction vehicle is an important issue for automation of construction process. We aim to develop sensing and visualization technologies for construction vehicles. Our target construction vehicle is backhoes. Construction vehicles are usually rented in construction fields. However, construction vehicles that can be rented do not have the sensing function. It is too hard to obtain backhoe position and manipulator pose without sensing information. This paper proposes an attachable sensor box that can measure backhoe position and orientation and the manipulator pose. The sensor boxes can be attached on backhoe metal surface by magnetic force without any additional manufacturing on the construction vehicle surface. By using WiFi communication and mobile battery the sensor box can be easily attached on large-size backhoe without wiring. After the work is done, it is easily detached by changing magnetic force power. At loading and scooping motion, backhoe arm and boom have large force exceeding 16 G. To attach the sensor boxes to the arm and boom, we designed an additional magnetic frame that can generate force of 1960 N. The sensor boxes were firmly attached to each joint and prevented to drop by any force from backhoes movement. We also measured the behavior of the backhoe in loading works in hot conditions over 30 Â°C and visualized backhoe pose and tip manipulator position.},
