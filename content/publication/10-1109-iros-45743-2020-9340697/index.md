abstract: "Backhoe loads sediment onto the bed of dump trucks during earthmoving work. The prediction of backhoe loading time is essential for ensuring safe cooperation between the backhoe and dump trucks. However, it is difficult to predict the instant at which the backhoe is ready to load sediment, because of the similarity in motions observed during gathering sediment. Moreover, since operators have different skill levels, the prediction requires a unique model for each operator. In this study, we attempt to predict the instant at which the backhoe is ready to load sediment into the dump truck. For this purpose, the beta-process hidden Markov model (BP-HMM) is employed to build a backhoe motion model for a specific operator. Time series data of backhoe loading motions for crushed rocks and wood chips, which were measured using 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors equipped at the cab, boom, and arm of the backhoe, were used for modeling with the BP-HMM. Several primitive motions of the backhoe, which occur at the completion of preparation before the loading process begins, were discovered as a result of the motion modeling based on the BP-HMM. We developed the prediction of the instant using three primitive motions. At best, the proposed method could predict the instant with a probability of 67% and 100%, at 6.0 s and 0.7 s before the loading motions began, respectively. This phased prediction can be used to reduce the idle time and risk for dump trucks during earthmoving work with the backhoe."
