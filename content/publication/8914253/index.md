abstract: "The proposal of this work consists in an approach based on the utilization of two Wi-Fi receivers, using RSS information received by the transmission nodes (Access Point) for the SLAM problem. The solution presented is based on extended Kalman filter using RSS coming from different transmitters in the environment. This approach was chosen because the Cellbot platform has two Wi-Fi receivers, therefore combining the two range-only sensors improves the precision of the system. The system considers that a robot navigates in an unknown environment where it receives different Wi-Fi signals from a known source. Through the odometry and Wi-Fi signals, the robot localizes itself and the position of each Wi-Fi transmitter. The results show the viability of the application, and an increase of 38% in precision of the robot pose by using proposed approach."
