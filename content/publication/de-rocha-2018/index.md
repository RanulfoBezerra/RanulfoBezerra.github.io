abstract: "In this paper, we present a fuzzy system for structural recognition in which the environment information is used to generate a topological map. The proposed method combines the recognized information from a given scene with a topological graph to create a map. This map can be used to plan high-level tasks of robotic navigation. The topological nodes are used to store semantic information, such as the robot's poses, sensor data and scene characteristics. The fuzzy system categorizes the structural information as either rooms, corridors or doors."
